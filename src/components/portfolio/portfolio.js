							Azurelo is my first Wordpress theme. I spent a lot of time working the
							design, and tried to have a very classy theme but only with the very
							essential. The hard part was to integrate it as a wordpress theme,
							validated by Theme Forest. I had to revise my basics in PHP. This has
							been a great experience to build this theme from an end to end. A great
							deal of attention as been put into the front-end architecture. I used
							PUG, SASS and JS bundled by the great Gulp.

								When I was working on my second theme (below), I really wanted to
								add some parallax effect I was on the Apple website. I hit a wall! I
								couldnâ€™t find any plugin that apply a subtle parallax effects on
								images itself, and not css background images.
							</p>
							<p>
								So I decided to put the theme I was working on in pause, and start
								to think on a parallax solution that would fit what i want.
							</p>
							<p>
								It wa the first time I has to created a plugin instead of simply use
								one. This is an exercise I would recommend to any developer. You are
								facing a lot of unusual situation. You oblige to think in a
								different way you usually do.
							</p>
							<p>
								First version was jQuery. Today the plugin is in version 3 in pure
								JS and ES6.
